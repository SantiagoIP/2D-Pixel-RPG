# Rosebud Game - Debug Summary

## üéâ **GAME IS FULLY WORKING!** (January 2025)

The game has been successfully debugged and is now fully playable with all biomes functional!

## Recent Major Fixes (January 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Canvas Visibility Issue** - RESOLVED
**Problem**: Game was running in background (audio, player movement, combat) but canvas not visible
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `.fade-overlay` CSS default opacity from `1` to `0` 
- Added explicit fade overlay hiding in `removeAllOverlays()` function
- Enhanced overlay cleanup to prevent black screen interference

### ‚úÖ **Biome Info Popup Interference** - RESOLVED  
**Problem**: "I" key popup was interfering with gameplay
**Solution**:
- Removed "I" key binding that triggered biome info popup
- Deleted entire `showBiomeInfo()` method and related overlay code
- Kept biome descriptions accessible only through biome selection menu

### ‚úÖ **Project Structure Cleanup** - COMPLETED
**Actions Taken**:
- Confirmed removal of duplicate `phaser_project/` directory
- Verified all core files are properly integrated and functional
- Maintained clean file structure with essential files only

## Technical Architecture

### üìÅ **Core Files**:
- `main.js` - Entry point and initialization
- `game.js` - Main game loop and state management
- `UIManager.js` - All UI overlays and menus
- `player.js` - Player character and combat system
- `monster.js` - Monster AI and behavior
- `world.js` - Procedural world generation and biomes
- `spriteUtils.js` - Pixel art sprite generation (all sprites procedural)
- `sceneSetup.js` - Three.js scene configuration
- `particleSystem.js` - Visual effects and particles
- `AudioManager.js` - Procedural music and sound effects
- `inputHandler.js` - Keyboard input management
- `buffs.js` - Shrine buff system definitions
- `noise.js` - Simplex noise for terrain generation

### üé® **Sprite System**:
- **100% Procedural**: All sprites generated from pixel data arrays
- **16x16 Pixel Art**: Classic retro aesthetic
- **No External Images**: Self-contained sprite definitions
- **Dynamic Coloring**: Sprites support color variations

### üñ•Ô∏è **Technology Stack**:
- **Three.js v0.152.2**: 3D rendering engine
- **WebGL**: Hardware-accelerated graphics
- **Web Audio API**: Procedural sound generation
- **Canvas 2D**: Sprite texture generation
- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript architecture

## Running the Game

```bash
# Option 1: Use npm script (recommended)
npm start

# Option 2: Direct command
npx http-server -c-1 -p 3000

# Then open in browser
open http://localhost:3000
```

**Note**: The game uses Three.js via CDN, so no dependencies need to be installed.

## Previous Issues Resolved

### üö® **CRITICAL: Biome Mismatch Issue** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: UI offered 7 biomes but game logic only handled 4
**Solution**: Extended `biomeProgression` array to include all 7 biomes with proper wave progression

### üßπ **Texture Loading Issues** ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Problem**: Console warnings about missing `castleWall` texture
**Solution**: Added proper error handling and fallback colors for texture creation

### üéØ **Game Initialization Logic** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Selected biome wasn't properly applied at game start
**Solution**: Updated `startGame()` to recreate world with selected biome

### üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Error Handling** ‚úÖ IMPROVED
- Added comprehensive error checking in texture creation
- Improved fallback mechanisms for missing sprites
- Better container management to prevent memory leaks

## Quality Assurance

### ‚úÖ **Browser Compatibility**:
- Uses modern Three.js (v0.152.2) via CDN
- WebGL-based rendering with fallback handling
- Web Audio API for cross-platform sound
- ES6 module support for modern browsers

### üß™ **Testing Verified**:
- All 7 biomes load and function correctly
- Monster spawning and progression working
- Player combat system fully operational
- UI overlays properly managed and cleaned up
- Audio system functional with all effects
- No visual interference or black screen issues

### üîß **Performance Optimized**:
- Proper memory management with dispose methods
- Efficient sprite generation and caching
- Optimized particle systems
- Clean server startup process
