# Game Debug Report

## Executive Summary
The game appears to have several initialization and rendering issues that prevent it from working properly. The main problems are related to the game startup flow, renderer visibility, and tutorial/biome selection sequence.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Tutorial and Game Start Flow**
- **Problem**: The game waits for a tutorial overlay to be dismissed before starting
- **Location**: `game.js` lines 128-143
- **Impact**: Game remains in a waiting state until user clicks "Start Game" button
- **Status**: Working as designed, but may confuse developers during testing

### 2. **Renderer Visibility**
- **Problem**: The renderer may not be visible due to CSS styling or DOM positioning
- **Location**: `game.js` lines 268-304 (setupRenderer method)
- **Observations**:
  - Canvas is created with RENDER_SCALE = 0.75 (75% of actual size)
  - Canvas positioning is absolute with z-index 1
  - The game div might have zero dimensions initially

### 3. **Game State Management**
- **Problem**: The game has multiple state flags that must be properly set
- **Key States**:
  - `isStarted`: Must be true for game update loop to run
  - `tutorialComplete`: Must be true to proceed past tutorial
  - `waitingForTutorial`: Must be false to allow game start
  - `isPaused`: Must be false for updates to process

### 4. **Biome Selection Required**
- **Problem**: After tutorial, game requires biome selection before starting
- **Location**: `game.js` lines 137-142
- **Impact**: Another blocking step in the initialization flow

### 5. **UI Manager Dependencies**
- **Problem**: UIManager expects certain DOM elements to exist
- **Required Elements**:
  - `#buff-container`
  - `#active-quest-container`  
  - `#dialogue-container`
  - `#minimap-container`
- **Impact**: May cause errors if these elements are missing

## Testing Files Created

1. **test_game.html** - Basic error logging test
2. **debug_test.html** - Bypasses tutorial automatically
3. **comprehensive_debug.html** - Full debug panel with game state monitoring
4. **minimal_test.html** - Tests basic Three.js functionality

## Recommended Fixes

### Quick Fix for Testing
Add a debug mode that bypasses tutorial and biome selection:

```javascript
// In game.js constructor, add:
if (window.location.search.includes('debug=true')) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.tutorialComplete = true;
        this.waitingForTutorial = false;
        this.selectedBiome = 'GREEN_HILLS';
        this.startGame();
    }, 100);
}
```

### Proper Game Flow
1. **index.html** - Shows tutorial overlay by default ✓
2. User clicks "Start Game" button
3. Tutorial complete event is dispatched ✓
4. Biome selection menu appears
5. User selects a biome
6. Game starts with `isStarted = true`

### Debugging Steps
1. Open `comprehensive_debug.html` in a browser
2. Check the initialization status panel
3. Use "Start Game Manually" button to bypass tutorial
4. Use "Select Green Hills" to bypass biome selection
5. Monitor game state panel for issues

### Renderer Visibility Fix
Ensure the game div has proper dimensions:

```css
#game {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    position: relative;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- RENDER_SCALE is set to 0.75 for performance
- Shadow mapping is enabled
- Multiple particle systems are active
- Consider adding performance toggles for low-end systems

## How to Test the Game

1. Start the HTTP server:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace && python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open in browser:
   - Normal game: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
   - Debug mode: `http://localhost:8000/comprehensive_debug.html`

3. Game controls:
   - WASD/Arrow keys - Movement
   - Space - Attack
   - I - Inventory
   - J - Journal/Quests
   - C - Crafting
   - M - Toggle minimap
   - E - Interact
   - P/Esc - Pause

## Conclusion
The game appears to be functionally complete but has a complex initialization sequence that can make it seem broken. The main issue is understanding the proper startup flow: Tutorial → Biome Selection → Game Start. Using the debug files created, developers can bypass these steps for testing purposes.
